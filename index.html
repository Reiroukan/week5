        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>This is my first semester at BCIT and I am <em>very</em> excited to start this new chapter of my life. I have <strong>no prior coding or web development</strong> experience but I am eager to learn as I plan to enter the technology industry after my time in this program. Outside of post-secondary education, I like to consume mamy forms of media (shows, movies, games, etc.).</p>
